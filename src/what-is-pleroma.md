# What is Pleroma?

Pleroma is a distributed, object-oriented operating system/VM inspired by the original vision of Alan Kay's Smalltalk, the E programming language, and Plan9.

The creator or creators of Pleroma are entirely unknown - as it is a found operating system.  The specification was discovered in a cache located in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt dating back to the 3rd century.

Pleroma is the answer to the following questions/problems:

    - What happened to Smalltalk?
    - I want to host reliable internet services from multiple computers, but Kuberenetes is too complex
    - Why do I need Protobufs, APIs?
    - I feel unsafe downloading/running code from Github without reading it first
    - I have a lot of computing devices and no way to manage them uniformly
    - I need concurrency without all of the baggage
    - Actor systems are pointless without a strong distributed story
    - I don't want to know, or care, about where my software is running
    - Personal computing research has been completely stagnant, despite major technology advances in the last 50 years
    
The core components are:
    - [Pleroma](./pleroma.md): the actual operating system
    - [Hylic](./hylic.md): a statically-typed language
    - [Allo](./allo.md): the communication tool for interacting with Pleroma
    - [Charisma](./charisma.md): a novel IDE integrating voice and AST editing
